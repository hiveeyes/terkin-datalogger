***********
At a glance
***********

Terkin is a flexible data logger application for MicroPython and
CPython environments. It provides a lot of sensor-, networking-
and telemetry-connectivity options.

Terkin has been conceived for the Bee Observer (BOB)
and Hiveeyes projects and was funded by the BMBF.

********
Features
********
Batteries included.

Overview
========
- Modular firmware framework
- Flexible configuration settings subsystem
- Compatible with MicroPython and CPython
- Concise, readable and modularized code which is easy to follow
- Decoupled code domains and data models for sensors vs. telemetry
- Based on approved modules from the MicroPython standard library
- Convenient development sandbox and test suite for quick iteration cycles

Architecture
============
- ``Datalogger`` and ``Device``
  are singleton objects representing the data logger application and the logging device.

- Components of the sensor subsystem wrap hardware drivers to generalize sensor reading.

- The telemetry subsystem uses different transport adapters to
  implement various connectivity scenarios.

Console output
==============
To get a better idea about how running this firmware will feel like when
watching its log output, we collected some excerpts at
`Running the Terkin Datalogger`_.


***************
Getting started
***************

Introduction
============
See `Getting started with the Terkin Datalogger`_.

The documentation covers the main features of the MicroPython datalogger firmware
and walks you through the setup process of the development sandbox environment
in detail.

If you feel you have questions about anything you might 
encounter during the setup and installation process or 
if you even have suggestions to improve things, feel free
to get back to us by creating an issue on the GitHub repository.

Download
========
On the `release page`_ , bundles of the most recent software versions
are available through ``.tar.gz`` and ``.zip`` archives.
These are suitable for uploading through Pymakr or similar
development environments / file synchronization tools.

Configuration
=============
Copy the ``settings.example.py`` blueprint into ``settings.py``
and adjust each configuration setting appropriately. The
documentation of all parameters is in the file itself
and should be reasonably self-explanatory.
For using Terkin with TTN/LoRaWAN find some more details
`here <https://github.com/hiveeyes/terkin-datalogger/blob/master/client/TTN/README.rst>`_.

Sandbox setup
=============
If you would like to contribute to the development or want to setup
a development environment for running the head version of this
software, please follow up at `Setup Terkin Datalogger sandbox`_
to read about how to install the MicroPython firmware development environment
and other software components it relies on and how to configure it properly.

The programming environment is command line based and has been tested
successfully on **Linux**, **macOS** and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
shipped with **Windows 10**.
