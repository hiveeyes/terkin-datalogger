- Add dependency management through "dist-packages" folder by using "upip" with MicroPython on Unix
- Improve framework layout
- Improve robustness of TelemetryClient
- Add DummySensor
- Add MemoryFree sensor
- Update documentation
- Add vanilla ``hx711.py`` by `David Gerber`_
- Add improved HX711 library by `Ralf Lindlein`_
- Improve documentation
- Code cosmetics, improve logging
- Add HX711 sensor component
- Update documentation and tooling
- Improve HX711 sensor robustness, don't block the device driver while waiting for hardware intercom
- Add watchdog timer (WDT) support
- Idle in the mainloop
- Naming things
- Run garbage collector on each loop iteration
- Prepare RTC code
- Ignore empty sensor readings
- Naming things, HX711 robustness
